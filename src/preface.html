    <p>This is a comprehensive guide of all elected officials who attempted to overturn a legitimate election and engage in a coup against the people of the United States in January 2021. They are also responsible for the violence unleashed in Washington DC on 6 January 2021, resulting in the deaths of five people. By spreading lies and whipping up hysteria, these congresspeople have created a very dangerous situation and there is every indication they will do it again given the chance.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, their attempts this time were thwarted, but they each remain in office for now. Until they all resign or are removed from the positions they hold, they will continue to pose a great threat to democracy. Remember - they all would have been fine with this election being overturned if they could have pulled it off.</p>
    <p>Each of their offices and as much contact info as is available has been posted below.</p>
    <p>These are the addresses to gather at. These are the numbers to flood with calls. People power is why they failed to overturn the election. And it's why they will ultimately be removed.</p>
